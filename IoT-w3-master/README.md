# Worksheet 3

## Overview
The gitlab repository contains:
- <span>README.md</span>
    - The current file, it contains an overview of my worksheet 3 progress and details on how to traverse the repository to find specific things.
- <span>main.py</span>
    - This file contains a number of function calls that display examples for Tasks 1 - 3 (within the main() function).
    - The file also contains all the functions that are used for the success of the project, due to the project being reletivelly small I decided that it was not necessary to split them into seperate files.
    - This file also acts as the examples section of the <span>README.md</span> file.
    - When you have seen enough of Task 3's while loop you can terminate the program with Ctrl+C or any other means to exit the program.
- <span>unittests.py</span>
    - This file contains unit tests that test the functionality of the code.
    - Due to this worksheet requiring less output than worksheet 2 I was not able to create as many tests however I still believe the tests that are present are sufficient to show the success of the code.

### Accessing files:  
There are no folders in the gitlab repository as there is a small number of files, so to access a file you can simply read about which file you need to access from the list above and select it from the same repository as this file.  
Additional notes if the list above is unclear:
- <span>main.py</span> to access the main code and a few displayed examples of the Tasks being completed.
- <span>unittests.py</span> to access the assert tests used to check the functionality of the code.

Sorry if this sounds condescending due to the repetition, that was not my intention, I am just trying to be safe.
